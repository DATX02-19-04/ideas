# Low Cost Low Power Controller
A controller that focues on reducing the manufacturing costs and the power usage. \
It might be able to last years

## Technologies
### Bluetooth
* PlayStation
* XBox
* PC
* Smartphone
   
### Sensors
Perhaps, if cheap and low power consumption

### Microcontroller
* NRF52-series
   - Low power consumption when programmed right
   - Integrated bluetooth (BLE, might not work with some consoles, need investegating)

### Indicators
* LEDs, off as much as posible

## Physical Design
### No case
* Faster
* Easier
* Harder to make more ergonomical
* A lot cheaper

### Developing a new
* As cheap as posible,
* While still not forgoing ergonomics

### Using existing
* Perhaps not in scope, from the focus of cost reductions
